# OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Debugger

## What is this?

Read the blog post: [Introducing the OpenID Connect Debugger](https://www.recaffeinate.co/post/introducing-openid-connect-debugger/)

Getting an OAuth or OpenID Connect flow working properly can be tricky. There's a bunch of parameters you need to get right, and it's not always easy to capture or parse errors. I wrote this little web tool to make the process easier.

## How to use the debugger

All you need to do is temporarily set your OAuth client redirect URI to `https://oidcdebugger.com/debug` (or `https://oauthdebugger.com/debug`):

Then, build a request to your authorization server using the debugger, and fire it off:

The debugger will capture the callback and help you understand what happened (whether success or failure):
